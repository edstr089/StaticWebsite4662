    <h2 id="mission">Our Mission</h2>
      <p id="mission">The Ambassador Program works to instill a sense of city pride in its ambassadors by attending community events and participating in acts of service. By traveling across the state of Minnesota, representing the city of Brooklyn Park, ambassadors get the chance to meet, network, and build relationships with other communities as well. The mission of the program is to grow young womens confidence by giving them real life public speaking and leadership experience. The program also offers a scholarship for those who are selected in order to use for continuing their education.<img src="Spud.jpg" alt="Spud McTater and Ambassadors" height="480" width="360"></p>
